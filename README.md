# Guzzle Converter Project

The Guzzle Converter is a BitBasket, FZC, Project that allows a project to convert to symfony/http-client
quickly and easily, as a drop-in replacement for Guzzle v5, v6, and v7.

It strives to conform to the PHP [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) and [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/). 

This is a drop-in replacement if you are having troubles upgrading Guzzle from v5 to v7, or
want to completely replace Guzzle with [**symfony/http-client**](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_client.html).
